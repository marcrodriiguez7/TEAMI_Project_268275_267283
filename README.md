# Time Series Forecasting Using LSTM in PyTorch

## Project Overview

This project implements a multivariate time series forecasting model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks in PyTorch.  
The focus is on daily weather prediction for Madrid (1997-2015), leveraging temporal dependencies and multiple input features including categorical time variables.

## Environment Setup

To reproduce the results, set up the environment as follows:

- **Python version:** 3.8 or higher  
- **PyTorch:** 1.10 or higher  
- **Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab** (recommended for easy GPU access)  
- **Other dependencies:**  
  - numpy  
  - pandas  
  - matplotlib  
  - scikit-learn  

### Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install torch numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
````

## Dataset Preparation

1. Download the dataset manually from Kaggle:

   [Weather Madrid LEMD 1997-2015 (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/juliansimon/weather_madrid_lemd_1997_2015.csv)

2. Place the downloaded CSV file inside a folder named `data` at the root of the project directory.

3. Ensure the notebookâ€™s path variables point correctly to this file (e.g., `data/weather_madrid.csv`).

---

## How to Run

1. Open the Jupyter notebook or Google Colab notebook provided in the repository.

2. Verify that the data path variables are correctly set to your local dataset location.

3. Run the notebook cells sequentially:

   * Data loading and preprocessing
   * Feature engineering (including categorical variable encoding)
   * Model definition and training with LSTM in PyTorch
   * Evaluation and comparison with baseline models
   * Visualization of predictions and metrics

4. Training progress and metrics will be displayed during execution.

## Notes

* GPU acceleration is recommended for faster training, especially on longer sequences or larger batch sizes.
* Random seeds are set in the notebook to ensure reproducibility.
* Hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and sequence length can be adjusted in the notebook.
